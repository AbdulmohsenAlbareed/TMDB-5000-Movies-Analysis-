# TMDB-5000-Movies-Analysis-

In this project, I will analyze the TMDB 5000 Movie dataset to practice what I learned in this section about dealing with data, e.g., gathering, cleaning, and visualizing. The TMDB 5000 Movie dataset contains 5000 movies that were extracted from TMDB (https://www.themoviedb.org) from Kaggle. I asked some questions about this dataset to find their answers via analysis and visualization. How many movies are released over the years?,What is the average revenue for each genre? Who are the Top 3 Movies (based on votes)? What types of genres are popular with people? What are the movie genres that are most popular with people? All of these questions will be answered in the last part of this analysis. Enjoy this journey!

- Note: This project is one of the projects provided by Udacity in the Data Analyst Nanodegree.
