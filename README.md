In this project will analysis the TMDB 5000 Movie dataset to practice what I lerned in  this section about dealing with data for e.g gathering and cleaning and visualing. TMDB 5000 Movie dataset contains 5000 movies that extracted from TMDB https://www.themoviedb.org from Kaggle. I asked some questions about this dataset to find their answers via analysis and visualization. How many movies are released over the years?,What is the Avg. of revenue for each genres?, Who are the Top 3 Movies(based on vote)?,What type of genres are fovrite to people?,What are the movie genres that are most popular with people?.All of these questions we will answer in the last part of this analysis. Enojy we this journey!
